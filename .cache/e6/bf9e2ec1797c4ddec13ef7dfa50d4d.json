Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally \"typeset\" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      This paragraph has its first line indented. I think first line indents\n      look rather stupid, but that's just my opinion.\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        I am a paragraph in blockquote tags.\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p class=\"big-margin\">\n      Most coders can find some use for margins. Unfortunately, some also\n      overuse it.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"border\">\n      Boders have many uses in styling, and can be used very creatively.\n    </p>\n    <h4>\n      You can also group elements that share one or more styles.\n    </h4>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      An example is this paragraph and the heading above.\n    </p>\n    <h2 id=\"id-element\">\n      All elements must have unique IDs. IDs are a way of targeting one\n      particular element in your document, as each element must have a different\n      ID.\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"middle\">\n      <h2>\n        Both this heading\n      </h2>\n      <p>\n        and this paragraph are contained in a div.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <img class=\"own-line\" src=\"http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/loris.jpg\" alt=\"Loris\" width=\"250\" height=\"197\">\n    <img class=\"own-line inset\" src=\"http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/loris.jpg\" alt=\"Loris\" width=\"125\" height=\"99\">\n    <img class=\"middle\" src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.GeAA0FO3BwC_e47_zDJbsgHaEo%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=e34b57a3e5e31cb000f0b26ac12db0d2f80fd174a09216dbb7a959eff2e2f9ff&ipo=images\" alt=\"adorable puppy\">\n    <img class=\"float-left\" src=\"http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/loris.jpg\" alt=\"Loris\" width=\"125\" height=\"99\">\n    <p>\n      I think lorises look rather silly.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"clear-wrap\">\n      So do I.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.airforce.gov.au\">RAAF official website</a>\n    <p>\n      If you want to know why there are so many exercises for programing, click \n      <a href=\"http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/why-exercises.html\">here</a>.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"#top\">back to top</a><br>\n    <a href=\"https://www.army.gov.au\" target=\"_blank\">official aussie military website</a><br>\n    <a href=\"https://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com\">\n      <img src=\"http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/robo_guy.png\">\n    </a><br>\n    <img src=\"https://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/stooges.jpg\" usemap=\"#stooges\">\n    <map name=\"stooges\">\n      <area shape=\"circle\" alt=\"Moe\" coords=\"59,59,47\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=moe+the+3+stooges&atb=v314-1&ia=web\">\n      <area shape=\"circle\" alt=\"Curly\" coords=\"126,93,31\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=curly+the+3+stooges&atb=v314-1&ia=web\">\n      <area shape=\"circle\" alt=\"Larry\" coords=\"208,66,39\" href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=larry+the+3+stooges&atb=v314-1&ia=web\">\n    </map>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Speed skating</li>\n      <li>Bike riding</li>\n      <li>Tennis</li>\n    </ol>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Lamb</li>\n      <li>Chicken</li>\n      <li>Beef</li>\n    </ul>\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <td>This</td>\n        <td>is</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>a</td>\n        <td>table.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <th scope=\"col\"></th>\n        <th scope=\"col\">Speed skating</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\">Bike riding</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th scope=\"row\">Funness</th>\n        <td>1000%</td>\n        <td>90%</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th scope=\"row\">Where I do it</th>\n        <td>Lilydale skating rink</td>\n        <td>Basketball court and Warburton Rail Trail</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <td>My favourite sport</td>\n        <td>The best sport ever</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">Speed skating</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <table id=\"simple-table\">\n      <tr>\n        <td>this is meant</td>\n        <td>to be</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr class=\"grey-background\">\n        <td>a very</td>\n        <td>simple table</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <form>\n      Please type something in this text box:\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"boring-text-box\" size=\"25\" maxlength=\"40\">\n    </form>\n  </body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"b945e47ef9b01d30cdfd2e27e28b3ef1","cacheData":{}}
